# Copperstone-Computers

Copperstone Computers is a mock-up brand for my final project at Ivy Tech Community College in SDEV 153 (Introduction To Web Development). The website uses features from Bootstrap v5.2 to minimize on CSS, and some JS only for front-end. 

You have freedom to do whatever with the website, and design itself though please follow guidelines laid out in GNU.

Attribution for the works of both Bootstrap for the front-end library and Flat Icon for the icon can be seen in the footer on all pages. 

Thanks you.
